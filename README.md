# refactor-this
Example of bad ineffective but working codes to be refactored.

This is for educational purposes.
All functions contain information enough for being refactored without any additional help.

## How to proceed.
Fork this repo and write your own implementation under each function with *REFACTOR_* prefix
ex. 
```
const someBadFunction = () ...
const REFACTOR_someBadFunction = () ...
```
